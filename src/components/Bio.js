            <p>My name is Mateo Strasdas. 
                I am a 2021 graduate of Camosun College's Information and Computer Systems Program.<br></br>
                Like many of my colleagues, my interest in cmputer software was kickstarted by a desire to make games.
                This led me to seek out programming knowledge by whatever means were available to me at the age of 15 (youtube, mostly)<br></br>

                </p>
